    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm a Full Stack Developer with a strong commitment to teamwork and a 100% dedication to goals. 🚀

      I graduated from Henry, where I had the opportunity to work on various projects that allowed me to explore new technologies, enhance problem-solving skills, and develop teamwork abilities. Constant exposure to different development approaches has enriched my perspective, adapting as each project demands. 💻🔍

      I am continually engaged in self-directed learning to further professionalize my skills and explore new aspects that contribute to my professional profile. 📚🧠

      Currently seeking job opportunities to elevate my knowledge to the next level and continue growing in this vast field. 🌐

      If you are looking for someone with a solid technical background, an excellent team player, and genuine passion for web development, I would be delighted to contribute! 🤝💻
